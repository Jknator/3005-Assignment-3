# 3005-Assignment-3

Steps for Installation: 
1) Install psycopg2 using the command "pip install psycopg2".
2) Open up pgAdmin4 and make a new database (I named mine Assignment3-1)
3) Open up program.py, and make sure the variables from lines 159-163 are correct and change them is neccessary.
    - The five variabes (name, database name, port, password, host) will be required to be as accurate as possible to your setup to ensure a connection 
    - If you named your database Assignment3-1 then most likely you will only need to change m_password to your password
4) Once you properly defined the variables, now you can run program.py by doing "python ./program.py"
5) Input proper arguments and get results
